# Final Project: Wedding Invitation Planner

## Objectives

1. Build a site with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**
2. Use JavaScript to create a **functionable**, **demonstrable**, **presentable web application**

## Background

Weddings. They're so stressful they often undermine the success of the endeavor they were meant to celebrate. We're going to help those newly-engaged by helping them face one of the big stressors: choosing an invitation format.

## Requirements

You will be employer-ready if you can answer the following questions:

1. Couples should be able to choose between **3 possible invitation styles**. Upon selecting a design, the screen should instantly update with the new look-and-feel
2. Couples should be provided the **appropriate input fields** so that they can put in their vital data. Data, as it is entered, should appear inside the currently active look-and-feel.
3. If you can think of ways to improve user experience, please do so! Our stressed couples appreciate **thoughtful user experience (UX)** that helps soother their addled nerves and nervous bank accounts
4. **Be Creative!** If you want to corner the market on Goth-aesthetic invitations, DO IT. If you think that super-kawaii anime invitations are your fast-track to riches and wealth MAKE IT HAPPEN. Remember this goes in your portfolio. Make sure your work is authentic and true to you.

## Non-Requirements

While you're going to use form input elements, you will not be submitting data to a remote server. You'll be using the power of JavaScript to do live, on-screen updates. Adding persistence will come in a later iteration
